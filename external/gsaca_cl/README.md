# GSACA

GSACA is an algorithm for linear time suffix array construction.

## Introduction
GSACA is a new algorithm for linear time suffix array construction.
It runs in O(n) time without use of recursion, using 12n+O(1) bytes of extra working space 
in addition to the 5n for the suffix array and the text. Performance is rather
underwhelming, this is just a sample implementation used for a master thesis,
"Linear Suffix Sorting - A new approach for suffix array construction" (to appear) 
by Uwe Baier.

## Build requirements
An ANSI C Compiler (e.g. GNU GCC)

## API
```c
/**
 * constructs the suffix array of the given string S.
 * @param S a nullterminated string of length n, i.e. S[n-1] = '\0'.
 * @param SA an array of size n, where the suffix array will be stored to.
 * @param n length of the string and the suffix array.
 * @return 0 if construction worked, -1 on illegal parameters,
 *	or -2 if not enough memory is available.
 */
int gsaca(const unsigned char *S, int *SA, int n);

/**
 * constructs the suffix array of the given string S.
 * @param S a nullterminated string of length n, i.e. S[n-1] = '\0'.
 * @param SA an array of size n, where the suffix array will be stored to.
 * @param n length of the string and the suffix array.
 * @return 0 if construction worked, -1 on illegal parameters,
 *	or -2 if not enough memory is available.
 */
int gsaca_unsigned(const unsigned char *S, unsigned int *SA, unsigned int n);
```

## Performance
GSACA currently performs quite poor compared to state of the art SACAs like 
[libdivsufsort](https://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort). Moreover, this is
an implementation of a SACA for proving its simplicity.
